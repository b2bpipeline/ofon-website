      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Privacy Information Access Preface</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Company is very concerned for the privacy of the users of our products. To this extent, no user information is collected except when necessary for using a specific feature of our products (Apple Push Notification Service, Firebase Cloud Messaging) and is never shared with any third parties. The only time information is requested other than listed here is for use in troubleshooting technical issues and of course, the user has the option to refuse in that case (though that may negatively affect our ability to resolve any issues).</p>
      <p class="mb-4">This privacy policy contains the full list of features built into the Application that in any way process users’ private information. Whether a feature is enabled or not, and thus whether the private information required for the feature to work is accessed, depends solely on the SIP account configuration in the Application.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Push Notifications</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">In order for Push Notifications to work, we must register your account remotely when the Application is in the background or closed on your iOS or Android device. To accomplish this, we transmit your SIP account details to SIPIS (our server that handles push notifications) over a HTTPS – secure connection. This information is shared with no one and is erased immediately when the push instance expires (usually within 3-6 days, depending on SIP account configuration) or the user disables Push Notifications in the Application. If the SIP account is configured to use one of our methods for multitasking instead of Push Notifications, this information is not sent to SIPIS.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Mobile App Contacts Usage</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">This part of the privacy statement describes how the Company collects and uses the contact information you provide by granting the contacts access permission in the Application. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your information and how you can access and update this information.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We access the following personal information from your address book:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Contacts' names</li>
        <li>Contacts' email</li>
        <li>Contacts' telephones</li>
        <li>Contacts' organization</li>
        <li>Contacts' postal address</li>
        <li>Contacts' birthday</li>
        <li>Contacts' gender</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">We use this information to</p>
      <li>Populate your Contacts data in the app.</li>
      <li>To import your favorite contacts into the QuickDial list, if you also enable the “Busy Lamp Field” feature on a contact, the favorite contact’s number (URI) will be included in your SIP traffic, but will not be stored anywhere.</li>
      <li>Enable the Smart Contacts feature, which helps you to make free calls and enjoy seamless communication with other users with SIP accounts on the same provider. If your SIP account is configured to use the Smart Contacts feature, we securely upload your contacts to the server in order to recognize Application users among your contacts.</li>
      <p>We will only use your Contacts information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Mobile App Location Information Usage</h2>
        <p>This part of the privacy statement describes how the Company uses the location information you provide by granting the Location access permission in the Application.</p>
        <p>We ask the location access permission only if the SIP account is configured to do so, and only in the following use cases:</p>
        <li>When the SIP account is used in a country with Dispatchable Location for emergency calls legal requirement. In this situation, the app attempts to acquire your location information in case a call to an emergency number is placed. Please note that emergency calls are usually routed to your phone's native dialer instead of requesting location access. Please consult with support to learn how emergency calls are handled for your account.</li>
        <li>when the SIP account is configured to send location data during SIP registration</li>
        <p>We will only use your Location information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>
